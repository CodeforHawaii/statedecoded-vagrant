# Specific Information for Code for Hawaii volunteers

We've forked off to provide a way for our volunteers to get up a
developmentment environment quickly and painlessly.

## About this Vagrant virtual machine

This Vagrant configuration gives us:

* The original puppet-solr repo instead of someone else's fork
* Our fork of the most recent State Decoded source
* More confidence that we can tell new volunteers to clone and 'vagrant up' to
  get a working development environment.

## FAQ

### Are we going to contribute our changes via pull requests upstream?

Probably not. Within the context of working with Git, we wanted to be able
to make fixes and commit them to a repo that others would automatically get
when they go to set up a working development environment.

It is possible that we could do a pull request if there was something
important enough to warrant it.
